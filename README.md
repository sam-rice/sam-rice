### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a current student in Turing School of Software & Design's Front-End Engineering Program and former film production technician. My time operating Steadicam and traditional camera systems on film sets taught me a lot about creative collaboration and technically-precise communication, which are skills I plan to bring with me into my next role in tech. I'm naturally curious about new technology, and plan to continue using this space to showcase what I'm learning and working on as my career in tech progresses.

### What I'm Looking For

I'm currently looking for my first full-time role in tech as a Junior Software Developer. I'm hoping to join a team that values autonomy, where feeling a sense of ownership over one's work is the norm. As my work experience would suggest, I'm a highly visual learner/thinker, and I'm particularly excited by media and UI/UX design. But ultimately, I'm interested in any role that offers oppurtunities for growth and exposure to new technology.

### Recent Work

Check out my recent project [Overlook Hotel](https://github.com/sam-rice/overlook-hotel) to see some recent work of mine! This was a vanilla JS project that shows off some UI/UX design that I'm pretty proud of.

### What I'm Currently Learning

As a lover of maps and history, I'm currently independently researching the [ArcGIS API](https://developers.arcgis.com/), and how to make public historical data more fun to interact with and explore via web applications. I should have a new personal project that uses ArcGIS here soon!
