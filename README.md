### Hello! ðŸŽ¥

My name is Sam, and I'm a current student in Turing School of Software & Design's Front-End Engineering Program and a former film production technician. My time operating Steadicam and traditional camera systems on film sets taught me a lot about creative collaboration and technically-precise communication, which are skills I plan to bring with me into my next role in tech. I'm naturally curious about new technology, passionate about graphic design, and plan to continue using this space to showcase what I'm learning and working on as my career progresses.

I also play guitar in a psychedelic rock band, and am a lover of trees and the great PNW. :evergreen_tree: :sunglasses:

### What I'm Looking For

I'm currently looking for my first full-time role in tech as a Software Developer. Most of my experience is in Front-End tech, but I plan to pivot to a Full-Stack position within the first year of my career, and am working towards that goal every day. I'm hoping to join a team that values autonomy, where being self-motivated is required, and feeling a sense of ownership over one's work is the norm. As my work experience would suggest, I'm a highly visual learner/thinker, and I'm particularly excited by media and UI/UX development. But ultimately, I'm interested in any role that offers opportunities for growth and exposure to new technology.

### Recent Work

Check out my React project ["Met Explorer"](https://github.com/sam-rice/met-explorer) to see some recent work of mine! I taught myself Redux in order to build it, and as a history-lover, it's something I'm pretty proud of. The app allows users to browse, save, and annotate the Metropolitan Museum of Art's massive collection of artwork and historical artifacts.

### What I'm Currently Learning

Since moving over to TypeScript and discovering the awesomeness of statically-typed languages, I've been teaching myself Java so that I can continue to build more full-stack personal projects and also ship code on the back-end. Working with more back-end technologies, in general, is an overall goal of mine, and I plan to have a Java Spring Boot project to show here soon!
