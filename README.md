### Hello! ðŸŽ¥

My name is Sam, and I'm a Software Developer with previous experience in IT consulting and film and media production. In my most-recent role, I had the opportunity to help bootstrap and architect scalable, modular UI codebases for enterprise-level fintech platforms.

As my background would suggest, I'm passionate about all things visual/design-related, regularly digging into aesthetic details and searching for ways to keep code clean and maintainable. I'm naturally curious about new technology, passionate about graphic design, and plan to continue using this space to showcase what I'm learning and working on as my career progresses.

In my spare time, I'm a film and history nerd, map-lover, andâ€”being an eastern Washington state nativeâ€”a lover of trees and the outdoors. ðŸŒ²

If your organization is searching for a growth-minded developer with professional experience, I can be reached at samsrice@gmail.com.

Here are some of my core engineering principles that I try to keep in mind:
- Ask Why: Investigate the "why" behind a new feature or patch. What's the nature of the problem that needs to be solved for the user?
- Modularity: Keep code as reusable and scalable as possible. Find ways to reuse design/render patterns while keeping components decoupled.
- Documentation: Use and write documentation as often as possible.
- Uniformity: Read, understand, and extend established design patterns when contributing to an existing codebase. This makes future refactors simpler and keeps developers working within the same mindset. 
- Refactoring: Whether replacing an entire package or a single line of code, always understand why the current solution was chosen before replacing it (Chesterton's Fence principle).
- Accessibility: Try to define a minimum a11y standard for all new features and stories and stick with it. Refactoring existing code for a11y is more expensive than integrating it from the start.

### What I'm Currently Learning

In my most recent role, the project I worked on featured a series of Java/Spring Boot back end services, which I regularly consumed and interacted with on the client side. Since then, I've been teaching myself Java so that I can better understand the software architecture behind enterprise-level projects in the future, and also ship code on the back end. Becoming a full stack developer is a central career goal of mine.
