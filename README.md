### Hello! ðŸŽ¥

My name is Sam, and I'm a Software Developer with previous experience in the film and media production industry. Collaborating across departments on technical matters in a fast-based environment has been in my wheelhouse for years, and is part of a skill set I've leveraged in software development too. I enjoy designing scalable systems from a high-level perspective, as well as digging into aesthetic and implementation details. I'm naturally curious about new technology, passionate about graphic design, and plan to continue using this space to showcase what I'm learning and working on as my career progresses.

I also play guitar in a psychedelic rock band, and am a lover of trees and the great PNW. :evergreen_tree: :sunglasses:

Since moving over to TypeScript and discovering the awesomeness of statically-typed languages, I've been teaching myself Java so that I can continue to build more full-stack personal projects and also ship code on the back-end. Working with more back-end technologies, in general, is an overall goal of mine.
